------------------------------------------------

Use your favorite JS frameworks to develop a simple single-page application that:

1. Allows a user to type a location into an input field
2. Presents a map of the location entered
3. Hits the forecast.io api to get the forecast for the next hour and displays in a user-friendly manner:
    a. The forecast for the todays conditions
    b. The minutely forecast data for the next hour

Include a test/tests to prove your application functions as expected.

How this is relevant to working at SweetSpot:
1. Creating clean, simple API-driven user experiences is core to what we do
2. Testing is critical being in the healthcare space
